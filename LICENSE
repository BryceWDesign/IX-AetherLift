**Special Notice:**  
IX-AetherLift-OTL is modeled on the Apache License 2.0 structure, with explicit modifications for dual-use civilian technology controls. It ensures transparency, public accessibility, and legal protections aligned with DARPA Open Source Framework (OSF) recommendations while shielding the author from unintentional export control violations.
