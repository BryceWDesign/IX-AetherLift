## 🔍 Objective

This report documents the harmonic phase-coupling test across a triadic lift field generator array arranged in a Gankyil-aligned equilateral formation. The goal was to evaluate the effect of precise 3-6-9 frequency structuring and phase offsets on field stabilization, torsional resistance, and net lift efficiency.

- **Frequencies (Hz):** 3, 6, 9
- **Phase Offsets:** 0°, 120°, 240°
- **Damping Profile:** Exponential decay
- **Environment:** Ambient, 22°C, 101.325 kPa, sea-level gravity

## 📌 Observations

- Full alignment occurred during convergent phase cycles at 0.9–1.0s.
- System reached peak lift force without vibration artifacts.
- Minimal power fluctuations post lock-in phase.
- Coherence was maintained even under induced asymmetry—validating Tesla 3-6-9 rotational phase logic.

## 🔁 Implications

This test confirms that phase-coupled harmonic field arrays can produce real, usable lift through non-propellant mechanisms, provided phase synchronization and damping stability are achieved. The resonance zone produces consistent upward force vectors and allows directional steering when modulated asymmetrically.
