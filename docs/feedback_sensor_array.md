## üß© Sensor Layout

- Sensors mounted in a rigid non-conductive grid frame:  
  **12 cm √ó 12 cm array** around central coil core

- 3-axis positioning maintained for each sensor (XYZ aligned)

- Redundant sets placed on opposing faces for failure mitigation and signal averaging

## üîÑ Data Acquisition Specifications

- **Sampling Rate:** Minimum 5 kHz per sensor channel  
- **Data Bus:** SPI/I¬≤C hybrid with differential signaling (reduces noise)  
- **Latency:** < 1 ms total round-trip from sensor read ‚Üí control system action  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Environmental Considerations

- **EMI Shielding:** Copper mesh Faraday cage around sensor PCB assemblies  
- **Vibration Isolation:** Gel-based dampening mounts to avoid false positives from external shocks  
- **Temperature Range:** Rated for ‚àí40 ¬∞C to +125 ¬∞C operation

## üßë‚Äçüíª Integration Notes

- Sensor array controlled via FPGA logic layer‚Äîno direct processor control outside diagnostic routines  
- Sensor failure triggers system mode fallback to Standby until maintenance
