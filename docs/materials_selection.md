## üõ†Ô∏è Procurement Recommendations

- Source coils and capacitors from aerospace-qualified suppliers with traceable batch certification.
- Avoid materials with high magnetic hysteresis losses.
- Verify thermal expansion coefficients compatibility between coil core and frame materials.

---

## ‚ö° Special Considerations

- All materials must be tested for outgassing under vacuum conditions for potential space applications.
- Surface treatments to reduce eddy current losses are recommended (e.g., silver plating, surface passivation).
- Structural components must be precision-machined to maintain coil geometry tolerances within ¬±0.02¬∞.

## üî¨ Research Notes

- Emerging superconducting materials are under evaluation but not yet integrated into IX-AetherLift baseline designs.
- Investigations into meta-material coil cores are ongoing for enhanced field shaping.
