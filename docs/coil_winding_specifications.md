> **Precision Parameters for Coil Fabrication and Field Uniformity**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Achieve minimal parasitic inductance and resistance  
- Maintain exact geometric tolerances for resonance optimization  
- Ensure thermal stability under operational loads  

---

## 🧵 Wire Gauge and Insulation

- Preferred wire: 32 AWG high-purity copper magnet wire, Class H insulation  
- Insulation thickness: ≥0.127 mm to prevent dielectric breakdown at operational voltages  
- Round wire preferred for uniform winding density; flat wire allowed for layered designs  

---

## 🔄 Winding Patterns

- Solenoidal windings with uniform pitch spacing of 0.5 mm ±0.02 mm  
- Multi-layer winding using interleaved insulation layers to reduce inter-turn capacitance  
- Use of bifilar winding techniques in secondary coils to minimize electromagnetic interference  

---

## 🧰 Tension and Speed

- Maintain winding tension at 150-200 grams to avoid wire deformation  
- Automated winding machine speed capped at 300 RPM for precision layering  

---

## 🔥 Thermal Considerations

- Maximum operating temperature of coils: 180 °C  
- Allow for thermal expansion compensation in coil former materials  
- Implement cooling channels in coil bobbins if thermal dissipation exceeds 5 W per coil  

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

- Use high-resolution microscopy to inspect coil uniformity and winding defects  
- Perform impedance spectroscopy on each coil to verify expected inductance and Q factor  

---

## 📏 Dimensional Tolerances

- Coil diameter tolerance: ±0.05 mm  
- Coil length tolerance: ±0.1 mm  
- Layer spacing tolerance: ±0.01 mm
