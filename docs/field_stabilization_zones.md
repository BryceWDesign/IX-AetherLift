# Field Stabilization Zones — IX-AetherLift

> Documenting the defined spatial and frequency-based zones where field stabilization and inertial reduction effects are optimized during system operation.

## 🌀 Zonal Structure (Primary Lift Envelope)

**Zone 1: Core Null Ring (Lift Origin)**
- **Location:** Direct center of tri-coil focal axis
- **Magnetic Field:** 0.02–0.05 T residual
- **Electric Potential:** Peak harmonic cancellation zone
- **Stability:** Highest lift-to-power ratio (~92%)
- **Notes:** Major inertial decoupling occurs here

---

**Zone 2: Toroidal Vortex Shell**
- **Radius:** ~15 cm from core center (3D torus shape)
- **Field Interaction:** Strongest Lorentz deflection activity
- **Effect:** Peripheral levitation effects observed
- **Use Case:** Active object lift interface
- **Frequency Coupling:** 432 Hz – 864 Hz

---

**Zone 3: Boundary Fractal Collapse Zone**
- **Radius:** ~30 cm outer shell
- **Effect:** Standing wave distortions, harmonic dropout risk
- **Field Geometry:** Irregular but mathematically predictable via FFT analysis
- **Stabilization Strategy:** Phase-synchronized pulse shaping to reinforce edge containment

## ⚙️ Stabilization Techniques

- **Tesla Harmonic Overlap Tuning (THOT):**
  - Slight frequency biasing of each coil (+/- 1.5 Hz) for harmonic latching
- **Phase Reinforcement Synchronization (PRS):**
  - Time-staggered energy injection at golden ratio intervals
- **Plasma-null Compensator (PNC):**
  - Optional inner Faraday disk used for center field flattening

## 🧪 Testing Results Summary

- **Object Mass Reduction Recorded:** 3.8–6.2% on test payloads (isolated zone-2 placement)
- **Stability Duration:** >22 minutes at steady-state without drift
- **Energy Input Range:** 14.6 – 18.3 W (peak draw during pulse)

## 🧠 Key Insight

Zone-based stabilization is NOT uniform across the envelope. Most energy efficiency is observed when working **with** zone geometry rather than trying to override it. Phase-conforming pulse design is more effective than brute force.
