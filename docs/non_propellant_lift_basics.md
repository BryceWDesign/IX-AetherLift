# IX-AetherLift Non-Propellant Lift Basics

> **Field-Controlled Propulsion Without Conventional Thrust**

---

## ✅ Core Principle

IX-AetherLift’s secondary function enables **controlled lift and motion in three-dimensional space** using harmonic field modulation.

**No chemical fuels. No reaction mass. No moving parts.**

Instead, it relies on structured field emissions that generate lift force via direct interaction with spacetime metrics and localized inertial fields.

## ✏️ Governing Formula

F_lift = ∇ · (E_field × B_field) + (ρ · v × B_field)


Where:

- `F_lift`: Resultant lift force
- `E_field`: Applied electric field vector
- `B_field`: Applied magnetic field vector
- `ρ`: Effective charge density in field node envelope
- `v`: Local field velocity component
