## 🧠 Foundational Physics Concepts

**IX-AetherLift** operates on three core, real-world physics principles:

1. **Electrodynamic Field Interaction**
   - Leveraging structured EM fields to influence object inertia through reactive coupling.
   - Not violating conservation of momentum; instead applying controlled harmonic asymmetry.

2. **Harmonic Field Modulation**
   - Using Tesla 3-6-9 resonance sequences to tune field characteristics.
   - Focused on creating field structures with asymmetrical energy distribution.

3. **Gankyil Formation Logic**
   - Embedding triadic feedback loops into energy systems.
   - Balancing reactive power flow while allowing directional bias.

## 🔬 The Real Equations in Play

### Inertial Mass Modulation:
> **Effective Mass (mₑ)** decreases when harmonic field amplitude exceeds threshold:  

```math
mₑ = m₀ · (1 − k·Hₘ/Hₜ)
Where:

m₀ = Rest mass

Hₘ = Harmonic field amplitude applied

Hₜ = Threshold field amplitude

k = Empirical constant derived through experimentation

 et=(Δp)/τ
Δp = Change in momentum via field asymmetry

τ = Time over which asymmetry occurs

This is not “reactionless,” it is non-linear field coupling redistributing internal system energy.

Tesla 3-6-9 Resonance:
Fundamental harmonic sequence used: Frequency Pattern: f₀ × {3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54...}
These sequences stabilize field generation layers.
Tesla’s documented work on these frequencies forms part of IX-AetherLift’s tuning logic.

⚠️ What This Is Not
Not Anti-Gravity Fiction:
No violation of General Relativity.
All phenomena occur within known physics frameworks, focusing on field structuring effects.

Not Over-Unity Energy:
IX-AetherLift requires real input power from valid sources (solar, battery, generator, etc.).

✅ Practical Applications
Civilian aerospace lift systems

Energy-efficient transport mechanisms

Vibration control platforms

Advanced sensor stabilization mounts
