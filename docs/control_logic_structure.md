# IX-AetherLift Control Logic Structure

> **Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Control + Gankyil Feedback Architecture**

---

## ⚙️ System Overview

IX-AetherLift uses a **hybrid control architecture** combining:

- **Open-Loop Tesla 3-6-9 Sequencing:**  
  Drives primary harmonic field generation coils.

- **Closed-Loop Gankyil Feedback Control:**  
  Monitors real-time system state and dynamically adjusts modulation parameters.

Both systems interact via a central control unit (FPGA or high-reliability microcontroller).

## 🧩 Tesla 3-6-9 Pattern Control

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize base frequency (f₀).
2. Multiply f₀ by 3, 6, 9 sequentially.
3. Cycle through resulting harmonics in triadic loop.
4. Adjust amplitude per feedback conditions.

**Example Pattern:**

```plaintext
f₀ = 9.3 Hz  
{27.9 Hz, 55.8 Hz, 83.7 Hz...}  
🔄 Gankyil Feedback Loop
Triadic Feedback Logic Includes:

Power Stability Sensor:
Monitors input/output power balance.

Field Coupling Monitor:
Measures real-time field strength via gaussmeter array.

Structural Vibration Monitor:
Accelerometer array feedback for mechanical stability.

🛡️ Safety Systems
Hard Shutdown Thresholds:

Overvoltage

Overcurrent

Excessive field amplitude

Failsafe Priority:

System safety first

No automatic restart without human override

✅ Open-Source Controller Preference
Recommended Platforms:

Lattice iCE40 FPGA (open-source toolchain available)

Raspberry Pi Pico W (for simpler prototypes)

Control Software Language:

Python or C++

Real-time task handling library recommended (e.g., RTOS or FreeRTOS)
