# IX-AetherLift Field Stabilization Protocols

> **Operational Guidelines for Maintaining Stable Harmonic Fields and Inertial Reduction Performance**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Ensure safe, repeatable, and controlled operation of IX-AetherLift harmonic field systems during:

- System startup
- Live modulation cycles
- Environmental variable shifts
- Emergency shutdowns

---

## 🛠️ Stabilization Workflow

### 1️⃣ System Initialization

- Confirm all coil driver voltages at nominal baseline (<5V standby)
- Engage sensor array diagnostics: Pass/fail for all sensor nodes
- Calibrate resonance phase controller using pre-set baseline values stored in non-volatile memory

### 2️⃣ Harmonic Field Ramp-Up

- Increase coil driver amplitude gradually over **60 seconds minimum** ramp period
- Real-time monitoring of:
  - Coil temperature
  - Power draw
  - Field phase angle delta (±0.25° window)
- Abort if any sensor exceeds predefined safety threshold

### 3️⃣ Live Operation

- Maintain:
  - Resonance frequency lock within ±0.001 Hz of target
  - Phase stability within ±0.25° dynamic range
- Continuous PID adjustment of coil drivers based on feedback loop data
- Log all modulation cycles with timestamped metadata for post-run analysis

### 4️⃣ Environmental Shift Handling

- If ambient EM fields, gravitational flux, or thermal spikes detected:
  - Engage adaptive phase adjustment protocol
  - Reduce power delivery by 15% while recalibrating
  - Resume full power only after field lock re-confirmation

### 5️⃣ Shutdown Protocol

- Gradual coil driver voltage reduction over **120 seconds**
- Return all sensors to baseline idle state
- Write all final log data to system storage

## 🛡️ Safety Considerations

- System cannot operate without valid sensor array input
- Field ramp-up and shutdown always performed in controlled, gradual manner to avoid sudden flux disruptions
- Manual override only allowed with authorized hardware key input

---

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

- Protocols codified in both FPGA logic and system firmware layer
- Human operator dashboard includes real-time display of all stabilization parameters
- Critical alerts: Audio + visual alarms tied to field phase loss or coil overheat conditions
