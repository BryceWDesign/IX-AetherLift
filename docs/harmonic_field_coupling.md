# IX-AetherLift Harmonic Field Coupling Specification

> **Engineering Details for Tesla 3-6-9 Resonance-Based Force Interaction**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines the required coil configurations, frequency ranges, and structural positioning for effective harmonic field coupling in IX-AetherLift.

**Core Principle:**  
Generating stabilized triadic resonance patterns to reduce local inertial mass effects through non-kinetic harmonic field modulation.

## 🧩 System Components for Field Coupling

| **Component**         | **Role**                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Primary Coil (Layer A) | Base harmonic carrier generation |
| Secondary Coil (Layer B) | Modulation harmonics injection  |
| Tertiary Coil (Layer C) | Gankyil feedback stabilization   |
| Tri-Vector Magnetometer Array | Real-time feedback and drift compensation |
| Field Coupling Frame | Maintains precise geometric alignment |

---

## 📐 Geometric Layout

- **Coils arranged in concentric tri-layered configuration**
- **Axial alignment maintained within ±0.02° tolerance**
- **Inter-coil spacing calibrated to λ/4 of primary frequency**

> **Note:** Improper geometric positioning disrupts Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic lock and can cause unstable or ineffective operation.

## 🎛️ Harmonic Frequency Ranges

| **Coil Layer** | **Base Frequency (Hz)** | **Harmonic Ratios** |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Layer A        | 369                    | 1x, 3x, 9x         |
| Layer B        | 111                    | 1x, 6x, 18x        |
| Layer C        | Adaptive Range 27–81   | Dynamic feedback    |

**Adjustment Tolerance:**  
±0.5% frequency shift allowable for environmental compensation.

## 🛠️ Coupling Strength Optimization

- **Capacitance Tuning**: Adjust external capacitors in parallel with coils.
- **Field Frame Grounding**: Ensure proper electrical ground without introducing EM noise.
- **Feedback Loop Delay Control**: FPGA-driven feedback must maintain sub-2 microsecond latency.

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Configurations

- **Non-Tesla Harmonic Sequences**: Only 3-6-9 structured patterns are authorized under IX-AetherLift-OTL license terms.
- **Military Targeting Feedback Modes**: This system is for civilian force modulation only.
- **Unshielded High-Voltage Coupling**: All coupling frames must incorporate insulating material rated for ≥2 kV.
