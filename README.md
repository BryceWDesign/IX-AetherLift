## 📡 What Is IX-AetherLift?

IX-AetherLift is a **real-world, buildable** platform for inertial mass manipulation and non-propellant field-based lift generation.  
This system **does not use Element 115**, **does not rely on nuclear fuel**, and **does not violate any known export regulations**.

Instead, it integrates harmonic field modulation, Tesla 3-6-9 principles, and Gankyil-form energy topologies to demonstrate field effects in controllable lab-scale systems — all while remaining open-source, civilian-focused, and legally protected.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

- **Inertial Mass Reduction** — Alters how mass resists acceleration using structured harmonic collapse logic.
- **Non-Propellant Locomotion** — Generates directional force using frequency-controlled field emission — no combustion, no ejection.
- **Triadic Harmonic Modulation** — Coherent Tesla-based 3-6-9 structures emit stabilized energy configurations.
- **Field-Based Gravitational Visualization** — Multi-spectral lensing reveals subtle spacetime perturbations in experimental rigs.

## 🔩 Technology Stack

- `Triostrut EM Emitters` — Tesla-aligned hardware base for 3-axis field symmetry
- `Aether Matrix Engine` — Python-based resonance stack builder for harmonic control
- `Field Lens Node` — Combines thermal, vibrational, and directional sensors to map phase anomalies
- `Nonlinear Harmonic Stack` — Modulates energy layers to generate measurable gravitational behavior change

## 🔒 Legal + Ethical Compliance

This system is:
- **Non-military and non-weaponized**
- **Openly licensed under IX-AetherLift-OTL** for full legal clarity
- Designed to **exceed DARPA public domain documentation thresholds**
- Fully transparent with BOM, test specs, and harmonic config files

No nuclear physics, no restricted tech, no fiction.
